## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **STEP 1: Get Correct FTP Credentials from Hostinger**

1. **Login to Hostinger hPanel**
   - Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
   - Login with your Hostinger account

2. **Navigate to FTP Settings**
   ```
   Dashboard → Websites → caiocastilho.com → Manage → Files → FTP Accounts
   ```

3. **Find Your FTP Username**
   - Look for username format: `u300282944` (numbers only)
   - **CRITICAL**: Write down the EXACT username

4. **Reset FTP Password**
   - Click "Change Password" next to your FTP account
   - Generate a NEW password
   - **COPY the password exactly** (case-sensitive)
   - Save changes

### **STEP 2: Update GitHub Secrets**

1. **Go to Your GitHub Repository**
   - Go to: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

2. **Update Repository Secrets**
   ```
   Secret Name: HOSTINGER_FTP_USERNAME
   Secret Value: u300282944
   (Replace with your exact username from Step 1)

   Secret Name: HOSTINGER_FTP_PASSWORD
   Secret Value: YourNewFTPPassword
   (Replace with exact password from Step 1)
   ```

3. **Save Both Secrets**

### **STEP 3: Test Credentials Locally (MANDATORY)**

1. **Download and Install FileZilla**
   - Download from: https://filezilla-project.org/

2. **Test Connection**
   ```
   Host: files.hostinger.com
   Username: u300282944 (your exact username)
   Password: YourNewFTPPassword (your exact password)
   Port: 21
   Encryption: Use plain FTP (insecure)
   ```

3. **Expected Result**
   - ✅ Should connect successfully
   - ✅ Should show `public_html/` directory
   - ✅ Should display "230 Login successful"

### **STEP 4: Run GitHub Actions Deployment**

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**
2. **Select "🔧 Credential Fix Deployment" workflow**
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Monitor the logs**

**Expected logs should show:**
```
< 230 Login successful.
< 150 Here comes the directory listing.
< 226 Directory send OK.
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **If Step 3 (FileZilla) Fails:**

**Check these common issues:**

1. **Username Format**
   ```
   ✅ CORRECT: u300282944
   ❌ WRONG: u300282944@caiocastilho.com
   ❌ WRONG: u300282944.caiocastilho.com
   ❌ WRONG: caiocastilho.com
   ```

2. **Password Issues**
   - Must be FTP password (not hPanel password)
   - Case-sensitive
   - No extra spaces or characters

3. **Account Status**
   - Verify FTP account is "Active" in hPanel
   - Check if domain is not suspended

### **If Step 4 (GitHub Actions) Still Fails:**

**Option A: Try Direct IP**
- Replace `files.hostinger.com` with `185.239.210.65` in workflow

**Option B: Contact Hostinger Support**
- Create ticket: "GitHub Actions FTP access blocked"
- Ask to whitelist GitHub Actions IP ranges

- [ ] FTP username is numbers-only format
- [ ] FTP password is reset and copied exactly

- [ ] Account status is Active in hPanel

**After successful deployment:**

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If nothing works:**
1. **Hostinger Support:** Create ticket in hPanel
2. **Ask specifically:** "Enable GitHub Actions for FTP access"
3. **Provide:** Your domain name and FTP username

## 🎉 FINAL NOTE

This is a straightforward credential issue. Once you have the correct username and password from Hostinger hPanel and update GitHub Secrets, the deployment will work immediately.

**The network connection is already working perfectly - we just need the right credentials!**
