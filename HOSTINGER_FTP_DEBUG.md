   - Automatic fallback on failure
   - Maximum reliability

3. **🔧 Debug Intensive**
   - System diagnostics
   - Network analysis
   - FTP connection testing
   - Maximum verbosity logging

4. **🌐 Network Diagnostic**
   - Complete network analysis
   - Port connectivity matrix
   - SSL/TLS testing
   - No deployment (diagnostics only)
